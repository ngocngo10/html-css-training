  <p>In this article, we will see how to create “links” in their HTML page which are linked
    to the section of the same page. In order to achieve this, we need to have some prior
    knowledge of some HTML features anchor tag with the “href” and class and id.</p>
  <p>Approach: Since we now know that the anchor tag <a> is used for creating any link.
      we also know that “href” can hold the link address. But in our case, we want to link
      to the section of same page, in that case we will us id to identify different sections
      of our web page . These ids then can be passed to the href as shown below:</p>
  <p>Example: In this example, we are dividing our web page into different sections using div,
    The first section has class “nav”. we can see that this section has <a> tags to navigate
      to different sections of our page. Then we have four sections, each is uniquely identified
      with the ids such as “section1″,”section2” and so on. This ids are given to the href of the
      <a> tags in the navigation section. whenever the user clicks on the <a> tag,it links the user
          to the particular section.</p>
